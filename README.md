# **JAVA-PROGRAMMING**
- Java is a powerful general-purpose programming language.
* It is used to develop desktop and mobile applications, big data processing, embedded systems, and so on.
* According to Oracle, the company that owns Java, Java runs on 3 billion devices worldwide, which makes Java one of the most popular programming languages.

* **``Platform independent``** - We can write Java code in one platform (operating system) and run on another platform without any modification.
* **``Object-oriented``** - Java is an object-oriented language. This helps to make our Java code more flexible and reusable.
* **``Speed``** - Well optimized Java code is nearly as fast as lower-level languages like C++ and much faster than Python, PHP, etc.
# **Syntax**
```java
// Your First Program

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```
# **Output**
```
Hello, World!
```
## Let's Break it DOWN!
**1.** ``` // Your First Program ```  In Java anything that starting with ```//``` are called **'comments'**,These are basically used for basic understanding and readability and had nothing to do with your code,A compiler ignores **COMMENTS**.<br>
**2.** ``` class HelloWorld { ``` In Java every Program/Application starts with class, ```HelloWorld``` is name of your class<br>
**3.** ```public static void main(String[] args) { ... }``` This is the main method. Every application in Java must contain the main method. The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method.<br>
```public``` is an access modifier, It is a entry point of java program.<br>
```static``` keyword is used to declare that the main method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.<br>
```void``` in Java is used as a return type for methods and indicates that the method does not return any value.<br>
 ```main``` method is responsible for executing the program's logic, but it doesn't produce a result that needs to be returned.<br>
 ```String[] args``` It allows you to pass command-line arguments to your Java program when running it.<br>
  ```args```variable is an array of strings that holds the arguments provided when starting the program from the command line.<br>
  ```System.out.println("Hello, World!");```is a print statement. It prints the text```Hello, World!```.<br>

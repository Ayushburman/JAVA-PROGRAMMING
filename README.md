# **JAVA-PROGRAMMING**
- Java is a powerful general-purpose programming language.
* It is used to develop desktop and mobile applications, big data processing, embedded systems, and so on.
* According to Oracle, the company that owns Java, Java runs on 3 billion devices worldwide, which makes Java one of the most popular programming languages.

* **``Platform independent``** - We can write Java code in one platform (operating system) and run on another platform without any modification.
* **``Object-oriented``** - Java is an object-oriented language. This helps to make our Java code more flexible and reusable.
* **``Speed``** - Well optimized Java code is nearly as fast as lower-level languages like C++ and much faster than Python, PHP, etc.
# **Syntax**
```java
// Your First Program

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```
# **Output**
```
Hello, World!
```
## Let's Break it DOWN!
**1.** ``` // Your First Program ```  In Java anything that starting with ```//``` are called **'comments'**,These are basically used for basic understanding and readability and had nothing to do with your code,A compiler ignores **COMMENTS**.<br>
**2.** ``` class HelloWorld { ``` In Java every Program/Application starts with class, ```HelloWorld``` is name of your class

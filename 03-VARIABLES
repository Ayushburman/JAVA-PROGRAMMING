A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory.
or 
It is the name of a memory location 

int Age = 60   ['int' is a data type] ['Age' is a Variable] [60 is a value ]

______________________'There are three types of variables'____________________
        1. LOCAL variable____2.INSTANCE variable____3.STATIC variable
  
1. LOCAL variable: A variable declared inside the body of the method is called a local variable
 . A local variable cannot be defined with a "static" keyword.
//LOCAL variable
void method()
{
int Age = 60
}

2. INSTANCE variable: A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method
//INSTANCE variable
public class vehicle {
   int doors;
   int speed;
public void run(){
}

3. STATIC variable: A variable declared as static is called a static variable. 
                   It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static
                   variable and share it among all the class instances.
                   Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.
//STATIC variable
public class A  
{  
    static int m=100;

}

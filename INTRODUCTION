JDK JRE JVM
JDK - JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT -provides tools for developing java Applications,
                            includes Compiler,Debugger and other utilities
                            
Java Compiler                - javac - (Convert Source code to Byte Code.)
Java Debugger                - jdb   - (Assist you in Debugging Your Application.)
Java Documentation Generator - javadoc - (Used to genereate API documentation from java source code.)
Java Archive                 - JAR     - ( Allows you to create, manage, and extract JAR files, which are used for packaging and distributing Java applications.)
java Decompiler              - javap   - (Helps to decompile java Byte Code  into Source Code.)   
Java FX Compiler             - javaFX  - (framework for building rich client aaplication.)

JRE - JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT - environment that provides the necessary runtime
                                 support to execute Java applications
                                 
Java Vrtual Machine                 - jvm - (It is responsible for executing Java bytecode and providing a runtime environment for Java applications.)
Java Class Libraries                   -  - (pre-built classes and APIs for performing common tasks.)
Java Runtime Environment Configuration -  - (onfiguration files and resources that define the runtime behavior of Java applications, including system properties, environment variables, and other settings that affect the execution environment.)
Java Plugin                            -  - ( The JRE may include a web browser plugin that allows Java applets to run within web browsers)
Java Web Start                         -  - (Java Web Start is a technology that allows Java applications to be launched and run directly from a web browser, without the need for manual installation or updating.)
Security Components                    -  - (The JRE includes security-related components that ensure the safe execution of Java applications.)
Java Deployment Tools                  -  - (The JRE may include deployment tools that assist in the installation and management of Java applications on client machines, such as auto-update mechanisms, installation wizards, and application cache management.)
Additional Resources                   -  - (The JRE may contain additional resources, such as fonts, graphics, sound files, and other runtime assets that may be required by Java applications.)

JVM - Java Virtual Machine  -It is responsible for executing Java bytecode and providing
                             a runtime environment for Java applications,The JVM translates the
                             bytecode into machine code that can be
                             understood by the underlying operating system and hardware
